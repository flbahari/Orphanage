<h2>MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p><strong>Founder & Main Trustee:</strong><br>
Rumah Perlindungan Nur Qaseh was officially established on April 6, 2011, as a non-governmental organization (NGO) under the leadership of its founder, Puan Roslida Che Wail. The shelter provides care and support for children ranging in age from as young as one month to 17 years old.

<!-- TIMELINE -->

<img src="images/Roslida Che Wail.jpg" title=width="200" height="200"/>

<p> The name “Nur Qaseh” was inspired by the girls who were among the first children admitted to the shelter. Puan Roslida prioritized helping girls partly because she has only two sons of her own and considers the girls in the home as her daughters.

Over time, the shelter expanded its services to include boys in need, broadening its reach to assist all vulnerable children regardless of gender.

The decision to establish Rumah Perlindungan Nur Qaseh stemmed from Puan Roslida’s active involvement in various NGOs and her firsthand experience witnessing the challenges faced by orphans and disadvantaged children in the community. She recognized that these children require not only safe shelter but also access to education and nurturing care.

Today, Rumah Perlindungan Nur Qaseh is committed to providing a comfortable living environment as well as opportunities for formal education and life skills development, ensuring holistic growth and a hopeful future for every child under its care.</p>
